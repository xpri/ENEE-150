Write a program that asks a user for inputs (max of 10) and then asks the user about which data analysis to execute. This process should loop until the
user uses the exit action in the ui.
7 functions to make! 0/7 done.

Display Data (not a function since I couldn't get it to work)    (Precision must be 2 decimal places.)
1. set up mock values
2. write the function
3. test the written code

Mean function
1. set up mock values
2. write the mean function
3. test the mean function with mock values

minimum function
1. setup mock values 
2. write the minimum function
3. test the minimum function with mock values.

maximum function
1. setup mock values
2. write the maximum function
3. test the maximum function with mock values.

standard deviation function
1. setup mock values
2. write the standard deviation function (take the square root of(difference between a specific value and the mean, then take the square of this difference, then find the average of all of the values.))
3. test the standard deviation function

average power function
1. setup mock values
2. write the average power function (square each value, then take the average)
3. test the average power function with mock values

number of zero crossings function       NOTE THE LAST VALUE CANNOT BE ZERO OR ELSE IT COUNTS THAT AS ANOTHER ZERO CROSSING!
1. setup with mock values
2. write the zero crossings function (essentially, plot the values, and connect the dots to find out all the zeros)
3. test the zero crossings function with mock values
